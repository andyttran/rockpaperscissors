# rockpaperscissors
A short repo that shows different ways to solve the rock-paper-scissors problem using recursion

##Problem:
What are the possible combinations that a player could play rock-paper-scissors for a 3 round game?
There are 27 different combinations.
[['rock', 'rock', 'rock'], ['rock', 'rock', 'paper'],... ['scissors','scissors','scissors']]

Write a algorithm that gives the possible combination for n rounds.
